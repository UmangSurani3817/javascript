<!--  What are all the looping structures in JavaScript? -->

<!-- Ans :- JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

for - loops through a block of code a number of times
for/in - loops through the properties of an object
for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true 


Ex. 

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}


while (i < 10) {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}
